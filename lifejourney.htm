        I studied here for only 2 years , i do have  many friends from  here but the bonding isn't strong as compare with other friends and  i dont have as such any special memory in this school.
        There is only one memory from this school which is memorable ,the match which i have played with my football team in rai barielly . The best thing i get fro9m this school is a caring best friend , her name is priya .
